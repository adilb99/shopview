### Purpose:
This is a personal project I made during my internship of Summer 2020. It is a working SPA website based on **NuxtJS** for an online shop with full functionality which supports products, categories, carts, reviews, orders, account and etc. 

It also features server side **rendering** supported by NuxtJS

### Technology Stack:

**NuxtJS** (VueJS + NodeJS + WebPack based framework) was used to build the layout and functionality of this website


### Back End part of the project:

This app has a back end part based on NodeJS and Express which is in a separate repository.
